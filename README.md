# BayesKAT: A Bayesian Optimal Kernel-based Test for Genetic Association studies

## Summary
We developed the BayesKAT methodology to detect the presence of any genetic association between a trait and a group of preassigned genetic features. BayesKAT can implement a kernel-based association test that automatically selects the optimum kernel using the Bayesian approach and returns an interpretable result by incorporating prior knowledge based on biological experiments or known biological mechanisms.
